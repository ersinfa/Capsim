                    Career success is based on the well-founded notion that obtaining skill-based feedback is an essential step
                    toward professional development. CapsimInbox is designed to give you specific feedback on the key skills that
                    drive immediate employability and facilitate your long-term promotability. Your individual development plan is the
                    critical first step toward self-improvement.

                <h4>The Value of CapsimInbox</h4>
                <p class="lead">
                    The value of this assessment derives from two factors. First, CapsimInbox gives you a context to take a serious
                    look at your current levels of skill. Second, CapsimInbox provides objective feedback that is based on a validated
                    assessment process. It is important to remember that people are rarely accurate judges of their own personal
                    strengths and challenges. A key reason for this inaccuracy is that objective feedback, such as the feedback provided
                    by CapsimInbox, is often difficult to obtain.

                <h4>Keys to Successful Personal Development</h4>
                <p class="lead">
                    Learning how to make skill improvements is a critical skill in its own right, and itâ€™s important for professionals at
                    all career stages. To truly master a skill requires both knowledge (knowing about) and application (knowing how).
                    To improve the skills assessed in CapsimInbox you will need to learn about what the skills look like when effectively
                    performed. You will also need to frequently and consistently practice these skills, which will often involve
                    trial and error. It sometimes can be a frustrating process, but if you stick with it, you can improve. Research suggests
                    five steps to guide you on the path to development:
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Observe Your Current Skill Level:</b> Observe and collect information about the specific behaviors you have targeted
                    for change. Completing CapsimInbox is a great first start!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. Set a Specific Goal:</b> Determine how much you need to improve and focus on one key behavior or skill at a time.
                    Avoid trying to do too many things at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. Learn About the Skill:</b> Seek out information to better understand the skill you want to improve. Find challenging
                    situations where you will be forced to learn and practice your targeted skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>4. Practice and Seek Feedback:</b> Actually practice the new behavior during all available opportunities and seek as
                    much feedback as possible to track your success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>5. Reward Yourself:</b> Provide yourself with rewards that you find valuable and are directly linked to performing the
                    desired behavior.
                </p>

                    The following pages document your responses from completing the IDP Builder on the skill you chose to improve.
                    This process spanned three steps: 1) Reflect; 2) Set Goal; and, 3) Create Plan.
