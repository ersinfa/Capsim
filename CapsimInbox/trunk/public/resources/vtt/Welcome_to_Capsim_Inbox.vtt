00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:03.756 A:middle
Welcome to CapsimInbox,
an interactive assessment

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:06.436 A:middle
that simulates a portion of a
typical workday for a manager.

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:10.756 A:middle
CapsimInbox is built to assess
key skills - Initiating,

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:15.676 A:middle
Problem Solving, Organizing,
Leading, and Communicating.

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:17.636 A:middle
Prior to the exercise,

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:20.066 A:middle
you'll complete a brief self
assessment before diving

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.936 A:middle
into your role, and
completing the exercise.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:24.706 A:middle
During CapsimInbox,
you will be placed

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:27.096 A:middle
into a management position
encountering an inbox full

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:29.406 A:middle
of interactions and scenarios
typical of your role.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:33.046 A:middle
Your primary objective is to
respond to emails and messages

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:35.676 A:middle
in your inbox as efficiently
and effectively as possible.

00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:37.936 A:middle
How you choose to
communicate with your team -

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.956 A:middle
including your supervisor,
direct reports, and assistant -

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.516 A:middle
will determine your success.

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:45.186 A:middle
There are four main
areas of the Inbox.

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:48.046 A:middle
Your email backlog - where
you can navigate messages

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:49.296 A:middle
and flag them for importance.

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:52.376 A:middle
The drive, where company
files are located,

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:53.986 A:middle
as well as useful
company information

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.256 A:middle
like organizational charts.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.246 A:middle
The email display, where
you interact with colleagues

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.696 A:middle
by selecting the best response
from the options provided.

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:04.276 A:middle
And, the instant messages
panel, which will notify you

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:05.336 A:middle
when you receive a message.

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:08.666 A:middle
Remember, this is
a timed exercise.

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:10.416 A:middle
Once you enter the inbox,

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:12.116 A:middle
you will have a predetermined
time limit

00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:14.516 A:middle
to select your responses
and complete the exercise.

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:16.826 A:middle
You can monitor your
time remaining here.

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:19.756 A:middle
You will not be able to
save and return later.

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:21.956 A:middle
Before you start the clock,

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.216 A:middle
make sure you complete
the self assessment,

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.576 A:middle
and review the information
provided about your company.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:30.836 A:middle
Upon entry - be mindful of
your time, think carefully

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:32.566 A:middle
about your options,
and do your best.

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:33.496 A:middle
Good Luck
