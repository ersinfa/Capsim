00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:03.756 A:middle
Welcome to CapsimInbox,
an interactive assessment

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:06.436 A:middle
that simulates a portion of a
typical workday for a manager.

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:10.756 A:middle
CapsimInbox is built to assess
key skills - Recognizing Issues,

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:18.676 A:middle
Investigating Facts, Identifying Stakeholders,
Generating Solutions, and Evaluating Consequences.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:23.066 A:middle
Prior to the exercise, you'll complete 
a brief self assessment

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.936 A:middle
before diving into your role, and
completing the exercise.

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:27.706 A:middle
During CapsimInbox,
you will be placed

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:30.096 A:middle
into a management position
encountering an inbox full

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.406 A:middle
of interactions and scenarios
typical of your role.

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:36.046 A:middle
Your primary objective is to
respond to emails and messages

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.676 A:middle
in your inbox as efficiently
and effectively as possible.

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.936 A:middle
How you choose to
communicate with your team -

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.956 A:middle
including your supervisor,
direct reports, and assistant -

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:45.516 A:middle
will determine your success.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.186 A:middle
There are four main
areas of the Inbox.

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:51.046 A:middle
Your email backlog - where
you can navigate messages

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:52.296 A:middle
and flag them for importance.

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:55.376 A:middle
The drive, where company
files are located,

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:56.986 A:middle
as well as useful
company information

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:58.256 A:middle
like organizational charts.

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:01.246 A:middle
The email display, where
you interact with colleagues

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:03.696 A:middle
by selecting the best response
from the options provided.

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:07.276 A:middle
And, the instant messages
panel, which will notify you

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.336 A:middle
when you receive a message.

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:11.666 A:middle
Remember, this is
a timed exercise.

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:13.416 A:middle
Once you enter the inbox,

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.116 A:middle
you will have a predetermined
time limit

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.516 A:middle
to select your responses
and complete the exercise.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:19.826 A:middle
You can monitor your
time remaining here.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.756 A:middle
You will not be able to
save and return later.

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:24.956 A:middle
Before you start the clock,

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:27.216 A:middle
make sure you complete
the self assessment,

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.576 A:middle
and review the information
provided about your company.

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:33.836 A:middle
Upon entry - be mindful of
your time, think carefully

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:35.566 A:middle
about your options,
and do your best.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:36.496 A:middle
Good Luck
